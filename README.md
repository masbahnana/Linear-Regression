# Linear-Regression

- What is tensorflow?
    - Library that allows us to easily build, train, and test machine learning models
    - Provides a black box approach so we get to ignore the complex algebra involved
    - Written in efficient C++ code but provides an easy to use interface
    - Models are constructed through a series of nodes that make up a graph
    - Tensorflow operates on tensors which are essentially arrays of values
    - Learn about basic tensorflow components and build a simple linear regression model
    - Go over core tensorflow concepts
    - Add tensorflow to pycharm
    - Explore some common node types
        - constants and sessions
        - variables
        - placeholders
        - operations
        - loss functions and optimizers
    - Training and testing
    - Build linear regression model
